NOTES while making the CLARA simulator

# cloud top height

MODS used CO2 slicing for pressures lower than 700hPa and ISCCP cloud
top simulations otherwise.

The default cloud_top_direction =1 which means the highest pressure
that matches the radiance-derived cloud top temperature. This is also
the direction PPS uses.
